# Things to do, in no particular order

## Small :
- [ ] Check and fix responsive of all pages
- [ ] Translate all pages to French
- [ ] When creating a network and having an account already, and being logged in, you should not be asked to create an account again, and not offered to log in, you should just be redirected to the network creation page (should be modified in the signup page)
- [ ] The network header, and the dark/light theme switcher should be visible only on network pages, so creating a network, switching, logging in, etc should not have it, propbably necessitate a refactor of, authprovider, theme provider, network provider, etc.

## Big :
- [ ] Add the possibility of having a custom domain for a network
- [ ] Add the possibility to customize profile fields for network admins
