# LinkPreview Component Improvements

## Summary of Changes

I've improved the LinkPreview component to better handle and display images, titles, and descriptions for shared links. Here are the key improvements:

### 1. Enhanced Image Handling
- **Better image URL resolution**: Images with relative URLs are now properly converted to absolute URLs
- **Improved loading states**: Shows a loading spinner while images are being fetched
- **Better error handling**: Shows a broken image icon if the image fails to load
- **Increased image height**: Preview images now display at 200px height for better visibility

### 2. Improved Title and Description Display
- **Better fallbacks**: If no title is found, uses the domain name as fallback
- **Enhanced typography**: Titles are now bolder (fontWeight: 600) and descriptions have better line height
- **Smart truncation**: Titles show up to 2 lines, descriptions show up to 2 lines for better readability

### 3. Enhanced OpenGraph Service
- **More meta tag sources**: Now checks multiple meta tags including Twitter cards
- **Better image extraction**: Looks for images in multiple locations including og:image:url, og:image:secure_url, twitter:image
- **Smarter favicon fallback**: Uses Google's favicon service as a reliable fallback
- **First paragraph extraction**: If no description meta tag is found, extracts the first paragraph from the page content

### 4. Better Error States
- **Graceful degradation**: Even when OpenGraph data fails to load, shows a nice preview with domain name and generic description
- **Consistent styling**: Error states now match the design of successful previews

### 5. Fixed Issues
- Removed deprecated `frameBorder` attribute and replaced with proper CSS styling
- Removed unused `handleLinkClick` function
- Fixed TypeScript warnings

## Testing the Improvements

To test the improvements, try sharing these types of links in the direct messages:

1. **Regular websites**: Should show image, title, and description properly
2. **YouTube videos**: Should display video thumbnail and title
3. **Spotify tracks**: Should show album artwork if available
4. **News articles**: Should extract the main image and article description
5. **Sites without OpenGraph tags**: Should still show a decent preview with favicon and domain name

## Technical Details

The improvements ensure that:
- Images are always loaded with proper absolute URLs
- Loading states provide visual feedback
- Error states are handled gracefully
- The component works well in both light and dark modes
- All content is properly truncated to fit the preview card

These changes make the LinkPreview component more robust and user-friendly, providing better visual feedback for shared links in direct messages.
