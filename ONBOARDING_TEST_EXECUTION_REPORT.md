## Critical Issues Found ⚠️

### High Priority Issues:

1. **Missing Authentication State Validation** ⚠️
   - **Location**: `NetworkOnboardingPage.jsx:95-110`
   - **Issue**: User without profile can access onboarding wizard
   - **Impact**: Could cause errors during network creation
   - **Recommendation**: Add profile existence check before rendering wizard

2. **Potential File Upload Race Condition** ⚠️
   - **Location**: `NetworkOnboardingWizard.jsx:710-762`
   - **Issue**: Logo upload doesn't clean up temp files on failure
   - **Impact**: Storage waste and potential quota issues
   - **Recommendation**: Add cleanup logic for failed uploads

### Medium Priority Issues:

3. **Missing Error Boundary in Wizard** ⚠️
   - **Location**: `NetworkOnboardingWizard.jsx`
   - **Issue**: No error boundary wrapping wizard steps
   - **Impact**: Uncaught errors could break entire wizard
   - **Recommendation**: Wrap wizard in ErrorBoundary component

4. **Welcome Message Animation Dependencies** ⚠️
   - **Location**: `WelcomeMessage.jsx:38-50`
   - **Issue**: Confetti animation may not clean up properly
   - **Impact**: Memory leaks on repeated welcome displays
   - **Recommendation**: Add cleanup logic for animation

### Low Priority Issues:

5. **Hardcoded Timeout Values** ⚠️
   - **Location**: Multiple locations
   - **Issue**: Fixed timeout values (2s, 45s) not configurable
   - **Impact**: Poor UX on slow connections
   - **Recommendation**: Make timeouts configurable
